INFRASTRUCTURE:
Make commands via PM work right (make generalized message formatter/handler)
Have him post logs to website or kd8 at the end of every day.  
Properly handle NickServ's

COMMAND LIST:
new list
print list
edit list 

memo (with notification)

roll
name
poke
word of the day
prolog interpreter
apl/j interpreter
make sure it's able to kill said interpreters
topic changer
cookie/hug
choice, a la flyingferret.  "cake or death"
emo


COMMAND REF:
ALL CAPS is a keyword, lowercase is arguments, [] is optional
Keywords can be synonyms.  For instance, kill, murder and annihilate can all
be synonyms for kill.

MEMO FOR name text

[PLEASE] KILL [name] [WITH weapon]

NEW LIST name

ADD LIST name item
ADD item TO LIST name

SHOW LIST name





Parsing should be flexible and look for certain keywords, but not require
all of them.  For instance, you could say "George, pmbomb 5" to get the last
5 messages from the channel, or you could say "George, pmbomb me 5" or "George, pmbomb Starfyre the last 5" or "George, pmbomb the last 5 from Starfyre"...



A good feature:
Have you able to request that George plays back the last few things in his
buffer at you via PM.  Useful for PM-bombing after getting DC'd or such.

Notify people that they have messages when they enter the channel.

Possibly garble messages a bit now and then, but keep the original around so
the full version can be recovered


Make high- or low-priority commands.  High: Logging, messages, etc.  Low:
kills, etc.  Make it occasionally refuse to do low-priority commands.


Feature request: Prolog interpreter.
Caveat: Also needs an APL or J interpreter, just to fuck with Mjolnir.
Also maybe Python.  And while we're at it, Scheme, Forth, OCaml...
The way to do this is to make a generalized program-linking interface, and
then only allow it to link with certain programs.

Feature request: List of valid people to kill who aren't in the room.
